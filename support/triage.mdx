title: Support Triage
description: A repeatable workflow to diagnose and resolve Mintlify docs + OpenAPI issues.
---

## Intake (copy/paste template)
- Workspace / site URL:
- Repo URL + branch:
- What changed last?
- Expected vs actual:
- Repro steps:
- Screenshots / error logs:

## First 10 minutes checklist
1. Confirm the issue reproduces locally (`mintlify dev`)
2. Check `docs.json` for navigation paths + syntax (commas, braces)
3. Validate OpenAPI (`mint openapi-check api/openapi.yaml`)
4. Inspect recent commits (`git log -n 10`)
5. Identify minimal repro commit and rollback option (`git revert <sha>`)

## Escalation criteria
Escalate only if:
- reproducible platform bug
- inconsistent behavior between local and deploy
- requires internal tooling access

Include:
- site URL, repo URL, commit SHA, local logs, expected/actual
