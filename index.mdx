## About me

<img height="100" src="images\avatar.png" />

Hi, I am Lilla, I like working close to real users and real problems. I’m comfortable jumping into a docs repo, running things locally, reading MDX or OpenAPI files, and figuring out why something broke, then fixing it and writing it down so the next person doesn’t hit the same issue. I care a lot about clear, **practical documentation** and about owning issues end to end, from first report to a clean resolution. This page is built the same way I work: hands-on, iterative, and focused on making developer-facing tools easier to use and support.
